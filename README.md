# Project Description
The goal of our project is to help find a suitable neighborhood based on needs. We used 4 datasets: 311 complaints data(from NYC open data), 2015 trees census data(from NYC open data), historical rent data from Zillow and NYC’s zipcode and geometric boundary data. We first used pandas and geopandas packages to load and clean the datasets. Next, we installed PostgreSQL and created a schema file to define each table’s schema. We then created 6 SQL queries to illustrate different aspects of our datasets. At the end, we created 6 visualizations using matplotlib to visualize the data points that will help us understand better. Our project aims to empower users to discover neighborhoods that align with their preferences, such as quiet surroundings with abundant green spaces. By combining data analysis, SQL querying, and visualizations, we provide a comprehensive tool to guide individuals in making informed decisions about their living environment.
